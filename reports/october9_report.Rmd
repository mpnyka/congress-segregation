# the average days per race of staffer

Here's the average number of days that each staffer worked in congress (it does not include days worked in non-member offices), by racial group of the staffer. However, these differences are only statistically significant for Asians at the 0.05 threshold. 

```{r}

staffers %>% group_by(race, core_person_id) %>% summarize(tot_days = sum(total_days, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(race) %>% summarize(avg_days = mean(tot_days))

staffer_total_time <- staffers %>% group_by(race, core_person_id) %>% summarize(tot_days = sum(total_days, na.rm = T)) %>%   mutate(white = ifelse(race == "nh_white", 1, 0),
         black = ifelse(race == "nh_black", 1, 0),
         hispanic = ifelse(race == "hispanic", 1, 0),
         asian = ifelse(race == "asian", 1, 0))
# 
# staffers %>% group_by(race, core_person_id) %>% distinct(core_person_id, year) %>% summarize(tot_days = n()) %>%
#   ungroup() %>% group_by(race) %>% summarize(avg_years = mean(tot_days))

# summary(lm(tot_days ~ black + hispanic + asian, data = staffer_total_time))


```


# number of days per race of member and per office

# number of offices each staffer goes to (by race of staffer)
This only includes congressmember's offices (not committees). Differences are not significant across groups. If I include all the offices, the numbers look very similar, with a very small but significant differences for black staffers (on average they work in -0.05 offices compared to whites)

```{r}
staffers %>% group_by(race, core_person_id) %>% distinct(core_person_id, member_id, .keep_all = T) %>% summarize(tot_office = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(race) %>% summarize(avg_office = mean(tot_office))

staffer_total_offices <- staffers %>% group_by(race, core_person_id) %>% distinct(core_person_id, member_id, .keep_all = T) %>% summarize(tot_office = n()) %>%   mutate(white = ifelse(race == "nh_white", 1, 0),
         black = ifelse(race == "nh_black", 1, 0),
         hispanic = ifelse(race == "hispanic", 1, 0),
         asian = ifelse(race == "asian", 1, 0))

# summary(lm(tot_office ~ black + hispanic + asian, data = staffer_total_offices))

# promotion model from ritchie within and across offices

# house member: how many staffers do they have every year per law-maker. 

Testing hypothesis: in white lawmakers offices thereâ€™s more entries and offices.
The data seems to support this. The differences for Black offices and Hispanic offices are significant, compared to whites (ie. On average, white lawmakers employ more staffers on a given year.)

```{r}

staffers %>% group_by(race_member, member_id, year) %>% 
  distinct(member_id, year, core_person_id, .keep_all = T) %>%
  summarize(tot_staffer = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(race_member) %>% summarize(avg_staffer = mean(tot_staffer)) %>%
  mutate(race_member = recode(race_member, `0` = "White", `1` = "Black", `2` = "Hispanic", `3` = "Asian"))
